Hisilicon SoC PMU (Performance Monitoring Unit)
================================================
The Hisilicon SoC hip05/06/07 chips consist of varous independent system
device PMU's such as L3 cache(L3C), Miscellaneous Nodes(MN) and DDR
controllers. These PMU devices are independent and have hardware logic to
gather statistics and performance information.

Hip0x chips are encapsulated by multiple CPU and IO die's. The CPU die is
called as Super CPU cluster (SCCL) which includes 16 cpu-cores. Every SCCL
is further grouped as CPU clusters (CCL) which includes 4 cpu-cores each.
Each SCCL has 1 L3 cache and 1 MN units.

The L3 cache is shared by all CPU cores in a CPU die. The LLC has four banks
(or instances). Each bank or instance of LLC has Eight 32-bit counter
registers. The hip05/06 chip L3 cache has 22 statistics events. The hip07
chip has 66 statistics events. These events are very useful for debugging.
The L3C support overflow interrupt for its 8 counter registers.
The overflow interrupt is raised when counter value reach 0xFFFFFFFF.

The MN module is also shared by all CPU cores in a CPU die. It receives
barriers and DVM(Distributed Virtual Memory) messages from cpu or smmu, and
perform the required actions and return response messages. These events are
very useful for debugging. The MN has total 9 statistics events and support
four 32-bit counter registers in hip05/06/07 chips. The MN support overflow
interrupt for its 4 counter registers.

The DDR conroller supports various statistics events. The Hip05/06/07 has a
total of 13 statistics events.

There is no memory mapping for L3 cache and MN registers. It can be accessed
by using the Hisilicon djtag interface. The Djtag in a SCCL is an independent
module which connects with some modules in the SoC by Debug Bus.

Hisilicon SoC (hip05/06/07) PMU driver
--------------------------------------
The hip0x PMU driver shall register perf PMU drivers like L3 cache, MN, DDRC
etc.
Separate PMU shall be registered for L3 cache and MN for each Super CPU
cluster.
For DRR controller separate PMU shall be registered for each channel in a
Super CPU cluster.

The available events and configuration options shall be described in the sysfs.
The "perf list" shall list the available events from sysfs.
eg. hisi_l3c2/read_allocate/ [kernel PMU event]

The Super Cluster ID will be the number suffix to PMU name
e.g. hisi_l3c2. Here Super cluster ID is 2 and so hisi_l3c2/read_allocate
is the event for read_allocate of SCCL #2.

For DDRC the channel number will be suffix at the end.
eg: hisi_ddrc2_0/flux_read/. Here Super cluster ID is 2 and the channel number
is 0 for the event flux_read.

The event code is represented by 12 bits.
	i) event 0-11
		The event code will be represented using the LSB 12 bits.

Example usage of perf:
$# perf list
hisi_l3c2/read_hit/ [kernel PMU event]
hisi_l3c2/write_hit/ [kernel PMU event]
------------------------------------------
hisi_l3c1/read_hit/ [kernel PMU event]
hisi_l3c1/write_hit/ [kernel PMU event]
------------------------------------------
hisi_mn2/read_req/ [kernel PMU event]
hisi_mn2/write_req/ [kernel PMU event]
------------------------------------------
hisi_ddrc2_0/flux_read/ [kernel PMU event]
------------------------------------------

$# perf stat -a -e hisi_l3c2/read_allocate/ sleep 5

$# perf stat -C 0 -A -e hisi_l3c2/read_hit/ ls -l

The current driver doesnot support sampling. so "perf record" is unsupported.
Also attach to a task is unsupported as the events are all uncore.

Note: Please contact the maintainer for a complete list of events supported for
the PMU devices in the SoC and its information if needed.
