Hisilicon Hip05 SoC PMU (Performance Monitoring Unit)
=====================================================
The Hisilicon Hip05 chip consists of varous independent system device PMU's
such as L3 cache (LLC) and Miscellaneous Nodes(MN). These PMU devices are
independent and have hardware logic to gather statistics and performance
information.

Hip05 is encapsulated by multiple CPU and IO die's. The CPU die is called as
Super CPU cluster (SCCL) which includes 16 cpu-cores. Every SCCL is further
grouped as CPU clusters (CCL) which includes 4 cpu-cores each.
Each SCCL has 1 L3 cache and 1 MN units.

The L3 cache (LLC) is shared by all CPU cores in a CPU die. The LLC has four
banks (or instances). Each bank or instance of LLC has Eight 32-bit counter
registers to count the 22 different statistics events. These events are very
useful for debugging. The LLC support overflow interrupt for its 8 counter
registers.

The MN module is also shared by all CPU cores in a CPU die. It receives
barriers and DVM(Distributed Virtual Memory) messages from cpu or smmu, and
perform the required actions and return response messages. These events are
very useful for debugging. The MN has total 9 statistics events and support
four 32-bit counter registers. The MN support overflow interrupt for its 4
counter registers.

There is no memory mapping for L3 cache and MN. It can be accessed by using
the Hisilicon djtag interface. The Djtag in a SCCL is an independent module
which connects with some modules in the SoC by Debug Bus.

HIP05 PMU driver
----------------
The HIP05 PMU driver shall register perf PMU drivers for L3 cache and MN.
The available events and configuration options shall be described in the sysfs.
The "perf list" shall list the available events from sysfs.
eg. hip05_l3c/read_allocate,cpu_die=?,bank=?/ [kernel PMU event]

The event code contains the information about the cpudie, module, banks and
the event code.
These are represented in Perf event attributes as
	i) event 0-11
		The event code will be represented using the LSB 12 bits.
	ii) bank 12-15
		The Banks or no of instances are with 4 bits. For PMU which
		have only single instance, this field will be ignored. For L3
		Cache, this will identify the bank. The 0xf value shall sum the
		count in all available banks.
	iii) cpu_cluster 16-19
		This identfies the CPU cluster (CCL) which share this PMU. For
		L3 Cache, MN, DDRC etc. which are shared for a SCCL, this field
		will be	ignored. For modules shared by a CPU cluster this can
		represent the cluster ID. This filed is reserved and unused now.
	iv) cpu_die 20-23
		This identfies the supper CPU cluster (SCCL) which share this
		PMU. For L3 Cache, MN, DDRC etc. which are shared for a SCCL
		this field represent the CPU die ID or (SCCL ID).

Example usage of perf:
$# perf list
hisi_l3c/read_allocate,cpu_die=?,bank=?/ [kernel PMU event]
hisi_l3c/read_hit,cpu_die=?,bank=?/ [kernel PMU event]
hisi_l3c/write_hit,cpu_die=?,bank=?/ [kernel PMU event]
-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------

$# perf stat -a -e hisi_l3c/read_allocate,cpu_die=0x2,bank=0xf/ sleep 5

$# perf stat -C 0 -A -e hisi_l3c/read_allocate,cpu_die=0x2,bank=0xf/ ls -l

The current driver doesnot support sampling. so "perf record" is unsupported.
Also attach to a task is unsupported as the events are all uncore.
