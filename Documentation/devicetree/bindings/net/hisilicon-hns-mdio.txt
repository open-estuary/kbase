Hisilicon MDIO bus controller

Properties:
- compatible: can be one of:
	"hisilicon,hns-mdio"
	"hisilicon,mdio"
  "hisilicon,hns-mdio" is recommended to be used for hip05 and later SOCs,
  while "hisilicon,mdio" is optional for backwards compatibility only on
  hip04 Soc.
- subctrl-vbase: specify a reference to the sub-control bus base address and
  the offset of reset, clock, reset status and clock status registers, please
  refer to the example.
- reg: The base address of the MDIO bus controller register bank.
- #address-cells: Must be <1>.
- #size-cells: Must be <0>.  MDIO addresses have no size component.

Typically an MDIO bus might have several children.

Example:
	peri_c_subctrl: syscon@80000000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hip05-perisubc", "syscon";
		reg = < 0x0 0x80000000 0x0 0x10000>;
        };
	mdio@803c0000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "hisilicon,hns-mdio","hisilicon,mdio";
		subctrl-vbase = <&peri_c_subctrl 0x338 0xa38 0x531c 0x5a1c>;
		reg = <0x0 0x803c0000 0x0 0x10000>;

		ethernet-phy@0 {
			...
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};
