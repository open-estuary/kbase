Hisilicon SoC hip05/06/07 ARMv8 PMU
===================================

The Hisilicon SoC chips like hip05/06/07 etc.. consist of varous independent
system device PMU's such as L3 cache (L3C) and Miscellaneous Nodes(MN). These
PMU devices are independent and have hardware logic to gather statistics and
performance information.

HiSilicon SoC chip is encapsulated by multiple CPU and IO die's. The CPU die
is called as Super CPU cluster (SCCL) which includes 16 cpu-cores. Every SCCL
is further grouped as CPU clusters (CCL) which includes 4 cpu-cores each.
e.g. In the case of hip05/06/07, each SCCL has 1 L3 cache and 1 MN PMU device.

The Hisilicon SoC PMU DT node bindigs for uncore PMU devices are as below.
For PMU devices like L3 cache. MN etc. which are accessed using the djtag,
the parent node will be the djtag node of the corresponding CPU die(SCCL).

Required properties:
	- compatible : This field contain two values. The first value is
		always "hisilicon" and second value is the Module type as shown
		in below examples:
		(a) "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-l3c" for Hisilicon SoC L3C PMU device
		(b) "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-mn" for Hisilicon SoC MN PMU device

	- scl-id : The Super Cluster ID. This can be the ID of the CPU die
		   or IO die in the chip.

	- num-events : No of events supported by this PMU device.

	- num-counters : No of hardware counters available for counting.

	- counter-reg : Counter register offset.

	- evtype-reg : Event select register offset.

	- evctrl-reg : Event counting control register offset.

Optional Properties:

	- module-id : Module ID to input for djtag.

	- num-banks : Number of banks or instances of the device.

	- cfgen-map : Config enable to select the bank.

	- event-en : Event enable value.

	- interrupt-parent : A phandle indicating which interrupt controller
		this PMU signals interrupts to.

	- interrupts : Interrupt lines used by this PMU. If the PMU has
		multiple banks, then all IRQ lines are listed in this
		property in the order of bank number.

Example:

	djtag0: djtag@0 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hip05-cpu-djtag-v1";
		syscon = <&pc_sysctrl0>;
		pmul3c0 {
			compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-l3c";
			scl-id = <0x02>;
			num-events = <0x16>;
			num-counters = <0x08>;
			module-id = <0x04>;
			num-banks = <0x04>;
			cfgen-map = <0x02 0x04 0x01 0x08>;
			counter-reg = <0x170>;
			auctrl-reg = <0x04>;
			auctrl-event-en = <0x1000000>;
			evtype-reg = <0x140>;
			interrupt-parent = <&mbigen_pc>;
			interrupts = <141 4>,<142 4>,
				 <143 4>,<144 4>; /* IRQ for 4 L3C banks */
		};

		pmumn0 {
			compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-mn";
			scl-id = <0x02>;
			num-events = <0x09>;
			num-counters = <0x04>;
			module-id = <0x0b>;
			cfgen-map = <0x01>;
			counter-reg = <0x30>;
			evctrl-reg = <0x40>;
			event-en = <0x01>;
			evtype-reg = <0x48>;
			interrupt-parent = <&mbigen_pc>;
			interrupts = <146 4>;
		};
	};
