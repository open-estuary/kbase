Hisilicon SoC HIP05 ARMv8 PMU

The Hisilicon Hip05 chip consists of varous independent system device PMU's
such as L3 cache (L3C) and Miscellaneous Nodes(MN). These PMU devices are
independent and have hardware logic to gather statistics and performance
information.

Hip05 chip is encapsulated by multiple CPU and IO die's. The CPU die is called
as Super CPU cluster (SCCL) which includes 16 cpu-cores. Every CPU SCCL is
further grouped as CPU clusters (CCL) which includes 4 cpu-cores each.
Each SCCL has 1 L3 cache and 1 MN units.

The below section describes the bindings for L3C and MN PMU's

Required Properties:
	- compatible : This field contain two values. The first value is
		always "hisilicon" and second value is the Module type as shown
		in below examples:
		(a) "hisilicon,hip05-l3c" for Hisilicon SoC L3 cache
		(b) "hisilicon,hip05-mn" for Hisilicon SoC MN

Optional Properties:

	- djtag	: The registers of modules like L3 cache, MN etc. are using
		the Hisilicon djtag interface.
		This field contains two values. The first value is the djtag
		node phandle and second value is the ID of the CPU die or SCCL.

	- interrupt-parent : A phandle indicating which interrupt controller
		this PMU signals interrupts to.

	- interrupts : Interrupt lines used by this PMU. If the PMU has
		multiple banks, then all IRQ lines are listed in this
		property in the order of bank number.

Example:
	l3c0: l3c {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hip05-l3c";
		djtag = <&djtag0 2>; /* DJTAG node for CPU die 2
				      * (CPU die starts from 1) */
		interrupt-parent = <&mbigen_pc>;
		interrupts = <141 4>,<142 4>,
			 <143 4>,<144 4>; /* IRQ lines for 4 L3 cache banks */
	};

	mn1: mn {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hip05-mn";
		djtag = <&djtag0 2>; /* DJTAG node for CPU die 2
				      * (CPU die starts from 1) */
		interrupt-parent = <&mbigen_pc>;
		interrupts = <146 4>;
	};
